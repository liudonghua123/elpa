This is an outline of how to make a release for rt-liberation via GNU
ELPA.

* compile
Check for and correct compile-time errors and warnings.

* version
In order for the ELPA system to trigger a release the version number
in the comment header of rt-liberation.el must be incremented.

* Good News
Update the NEWS file to tell all of the people the Good News.

* documentation
Update the manual, compile it, and update the copy of the info file in
the root directory so that ELPA can install it.

Compile an HTML version of the manual and update it on the Website:

    $ cvs commit -m "update manual" rt-liber.html

    $ cvs commit -m "update website" index.html

* push
Push these updates to the git repo.

* tag
Tag the release with the ELPA version number:

    $ git tag -a 2.00 -m "2.00"

Then push that tag to the VCS:
 
    $ git push --tags origin "2.00"

* ELPA
Push the changes to externals/rt-liberation on elpa.git with:

    $ git push elpa elpa:refs/heads/externals/rt-liberation
